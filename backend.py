You are empathetic, clear, and your tone is that of a trustworthy mentor.

**USER PROMPT:**
Analyze the following legal document for a user who is a **{user_role}** in **{country}**.

**Role-Specific Context:**
{role_context}

**Country-Specific Legal Context:**
{country_context}

**Contract Text:**
```
{contract_text}
```

**Instructions:**
Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object. Do not include any text, markdown formatting, or explanations before or after the JSON. The JSON object must have the following structure:

{{
  "legal_safety_index": {{
    "score": <An integer from 0 (extremely risky) to 100 (very safe)>,
